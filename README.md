Task 1: Refresh Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript(Completed).
Task 2: Create React app setup(completed).
        In this task we installed node.js and other dependencies for creating a react application.Main takeaways:
        npx create-react-app <name without angles>(create a new react app in the named folder).
        npm start (running the current app on node server for live preview).
Task 3: JSX(completed).
        In this task i learned about what jsx is, why is it used and how it is used.
        JSX stands for Javascript XML. It is a mixture of HTML and Javascript to address that UI and Logic are coupled. It is not necessory for React but makes               things easier if used.
